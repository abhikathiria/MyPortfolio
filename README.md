## About Me
I am an aspiring Game Designer and Developer with a background in Information Technology. I have completed my B.E from A D Patel Institute of Technology, Anand. My academic journey, combined with hands-on internship experience in backend and database development, has helped me build a strong foundation in software engineering while fueling my passion for game development. Though I currently have foundational knowledge in game design, I am actively working to strengthen my skills and explore new technologies that bridge creativity and interactivity.

## Goals
My career goal is to become a highly skilled game developer capable of designing immersive and innovative gaming experiences. Eventually, I aim deepen my technical foundation through a master’s degree. My ultimate aspiration is to contribute meaningfully to India’s fast-growing gaming and interactive technology industry.
